# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- Set-operation lineage branch roots now expose structured metadata with the
  operator, original zero-based branch ordinal, and `ALL` flag across Rust,
  FFI, Python, WASM/TypeScript, and Go.
- Compact query analysis classifies set-operation branches as `value` or
  `filter` contributions.

### Changed
- OpenLineage generation now supports top-level set-operation queries. Both
  `UNION` inputs remain direct dependencies, while right-hand `EXCEPT` and
  `INTERSECT` inputs use indirect `FILTER` transformations. A shared input field
  can contain both transformations.
- Rust callers that construct `LineageNode` with a struct literal must
  initialize the new optional `set_branch` field.

### Fixed
- Partial set-operation lineage no longer compresses branch positions when one
  branch cannot be resolved, so surviving lineage nodes retain their original
  ordinal.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- Column lineage can now target a zero-based output ordinal, including across
  `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` branches whose output names differ. The
  ordinal APIs are available in Rust, Python, C, Go, WASM, and TypeScript, with
  schema-aware variants in every binding.
- New output-column inspection APIs preserve projection order, unnamed
  expressions, and unresolved qualified or unqualified wildcards. Returned
  metadata reports whether all output ordinals are known and can expand stars
  when schema metadata is supplied.
- Column-resolution failures now distinguish `not_found`, `indeterminate`, and
  `ambiguous` outcomes. Python exposes `ColumnResolutionError`, C uses stable
  status codes, Go provides `errors.Is`-compatible sentinels, and WASM/
  TypeScript return structured failure metadata.

### Fixed
- Positional lineage for set operations now keeps the resolvable branches when
  another branch has an unresolved wildcard, while still reporting an
  indeterminate result when no branch can establish the requested position.
- Name-based lineage no longer guesses when duplicate output aliases make the
  requested name ambiguous.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- Oracle data types now have structured parsing and generation for numeric,
  character, temporal, interval, large-object, raw, and row-identifier types,
  including precision, scale, length semantics, and time-zone qualifiers.
  Compatible mappings are available for PostgreSQL, MySQL, T-SQL, and Fabric,
  while strict mode rejects lossy conversions.
- T-SQL, Fabric, MySQL, and SQLite now accept single-quoted select-list aliases
  with or without `AS` and emit the target dialect's identifier quoting. The
  syntax remains gated to dialects that support it.
- PostgreSQL parsing and generation now support `SET [LOCAL | SESSION] SESSION
  AUTHORIZATION`, `RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION`, and role-membership
  `GRANT`/`REVOKE` statements without an `ON` clause. Statement boundaries and
  structured object-privilege grants are preserved.

### Fixed
- Schema-aware type annotation and lineage now propagate scalar element types
  from select-list and table-valued `UNNEST` expressions through CTEs and
  derived tables. Virtual aliases remain scope-local, so reused aliases in
  sibling CTEs cannot overwrite one another's inferred types.
- MySQL 8 functional index key parts now parse and generate structurally in
  table definitions, `ALTER TABLE ... ADD INDEX`, and standalone `CREATE
  INDEX` statements. Mixed column and expression parts, prefix lengths,
  `ASC`/`DESC`, unique indexes, and character-set introducers are preserved
  instead of rejecting the DDL or replacing expressions with `?`.
- PostgreSQL row-value equality against scalar subqueries now lowers to
  T-SQL/Fabric scalar `CASE` subqueries with correct true, false, and null
  behavior. Zero- and multi-row cardinality, query modifiers, explicit aliases,
  projection counts, and generated-alias collisions are handled correctly.
- CTE star expansion and lineage analysis now process every branch of nested
  `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` expressions instead of only the leftmost
  branch, while retaining conservative behavior for recursive or unresolved
  references.
- PostgreSQL hexadecimal `bytea` literals now lower to T-SQL/Fabric binary
  literals, including empty values, embedded whitespace, and values passed to
  `SET_BIT`. Strict mode rejects malformed, odd-length, or unsupported escape-
  format literals instead of emitting incorrect SQL.
- PostgreSQL `TO_NUMBER` formats containing grouping separators or positional
  spaces are no longer translated to unsafe T-SQL/Fabric `TRY_CONVERT` calls.
  Default mode preserves the source function and strict mode rejects the lossy
  conversion, while simple supported formats still use `TRY_CONVERT`.
- T-SQL and Fabric generation now emits `LEN` rather than `LENGTH` for parsed
  length expressions, including Rust and WASM/TypeScript round trips.
- `SEED` and `REPEATABLE` can now be used as implicit table aliases in T-SQL
  and Fabric without breaking their existing `TABLESAMPLE` clause handling.
- PostgreSQL `date_part` second, millisecond, and microsecond fields over
  timestamp values now compose the complete seconds value when targeting
  T-SQL/Fabric, including fractional portions and timestamp-with-time-zone
  inputs.
- Parenthesized joined-table groups followed by `OUTER APPLY` now reparse
  correctly in T-SQL and Fabric, making generated join groups round-trip safe.
- PostgreSQL quantified comparisons against literal arrays now lower across
  the full operator set for T-SQL/Fabric: equality and inequality use
  `IN`/`NOT IN`, other `ANY`/`ALL` operators use boolean chains, and empty
  arrays produce the correct constant result. Typed values and null semantics
  are preserved, while dynamic arrays remain rejected.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- TiDB parsing and generation now cover `AUTO_RANDOM` attributes, including
  shard/range parameters and executable comments; distributed table options
  such as `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS`, `PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS`, and `AUTO_RANDOM_BASE`;
  placement and TTL options; their `ALTER TABLE` forms; and `SPLIT TABLE` and
  `FLASHBACK TABLE` statements. The structured AST is available consistently
  through the Rust, Python, C FFI, Go, WASM, and TypeScript parse/generate APIs.

### Changed
- CTE-heavy lineage now indexes each scope once and traverses stable scope IDs
  instead of repeatedly cloning nested CTE scope trees. The public `Scope` and
  lineage APIs remain unchanged, while benchmarks now cover flat, nested, and
  multiply referenced CTE shapes.
- Strict PostgreSQL/CockroachDB-to-T-SQL/Fabric transpilation now keeps the
  existing best-effort `VARCHAR(MAX)` conversion for column-to-text casts whose
  source type is unavailable, rather than rejecting otherwise valid queries.

### Fixed
- PostgreSQL-family parsing now accepts parenthesized `EXPLAIN` option lists,
  including comma-separated flags and values, while preserving parenthesized
  query bodies and normalizing `ANALYZE` consistently with the bare form.
- PostgreSQL compound intervals now retain all fields and lower through
  operand-aware `DATEADD` chains for T-SQL/Fabric, including fractional
  seconds, subtraction, and `TIME` wraparound. Strict mode rejects unresolved
  operand types and intervals that cannot be represented safely instead of
  emitting malformed or lossy SQL.
- PostgreSQL `MAKE_TIME` now lowers to `TIMEFROMPARTS` with fractional-second
  precision for T-SQL/Fabric. Single-value `CONCAT`/`CONCAT_WS` calls meet the
  target minimum arity, and mixed-type `||` operands are converted to strings
  before using T-SQL concatenation.
- PostgreSQL SQL/JSON constructors and aggregates now translate `RETURNING`
  clauses to compatible T-SQL/Fabric output: native JSON return types are
  omitted, supported character return types use an outer cast, and unsafe
  types fail in strict mode. `json_agg`/`jsonb_agg` preserve PostgreSQL null and
  ordering semantics while unsupported modifiers are rejected.
- Nested PostgreSQL grouping sets are flattened without being mistaken for row
  values, and inert `ORDER BY` clauses inside unbounded set-operation arms are
  removed for T-SQL/Fabric.
- PostgreSQL boolean predicates nested inside casts, aggregates, functions, or
  arithmetic now materialize as nullable scalar values before T-SQL/Fabric
  conversion, preserving three-valued logic.
- PostgreSQL `date_part` results now retain their `double precision` contract
  for T-SQL/Fabric, while `EXTRACT` keeps its field-specific type. Time-based
  second, millisecond, microsecond, and epoch calculations preserve complete
  values without overflow.
- PostgreSQL string semantics now map more faithfully to T-SQL/Fabric,
  including deparsed `LIKE_ESCAPE`, numeric-start `SUBSTRING`, text-cast trim
  sets, literal `TRANSLATE`, unpadded `to_hex`, hexadecimal encode/decode, and
  `SHA256`/`SHA512`. Strict mode rejects regular-expression functions,
  unsupported digest widths, and other string operations without a faithful
  target equivalent.
- PostgreSQL float-to-integer rounding now also recognizes parenthesized cast
  chains before applying the target-side rounding conversion.
- Snowflake string parsing and generation now round-trip doubled quotes,
  backslash escape sequences, control characters, dollar-quoted strings, and
  function-body literals without losing or double-escaping content.
- Shared AST transformations now recurse through `ALL`/`ANY` quantified
  comparisons and null-safe comparison operands, preserving bottom-up
  transformation order across all public transform entry points.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- PostgreSQL `VALUES` derived tables without explicit column aliases now gain
  deterministic `column1`, `column2`, ... aliases when targeting T-SQL or
  Fabric, producing valid derived-table syntax while preserving user-provided
  aliases.
- PostgreSQL boolean operator functions, boolean literals, logical scalar
  values, and known boolean-to-text casts now lower with the correct T-SQL and
  Fabric value semantics, including nullable predicates. Strict mode rejects
  column-to-text casts when the source type is unknown rather than applying an
  unsafe boolean assumption.
- Simple `CASE operand WHEN value` expressions now keep their `WHEN` arms as
  scalar comparison values during T-SQL/Fabric boolean normalization, while
  searched `CASE WHEN predicate` expressions continue to use predicate
  rewriting.
- PostgreSQL casts from `REAL`, `FLOAT4`, `FLOAT8`, and `DOUBLE PRECISION` to
  integer types now apply PostgreSQL-compatible rounding before the
  truncating T-SQL/Fabric integer cast. Numeric casts and unresolved source
  types retain their existing behavior.
- PostgreSQL `EXTRACT` and `date_part` over `TIME` values now preserve complete
  fractional-second composition for `SECOND`, `MILLISECOND`, `MICROSECOND`,
  and `EPOCH` when targeting T-SQL/Fabric instead of returning only a
  `DATEPART` component.
- Strict PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric transpilation now rejects unsupported
  scalar row/composite constructors, composite field access, and qualified
  whole-row casts instead of emitting invalid target SQL. Valid table `VALUES`
  constructors and supported JSON aggregation remain accepted.
- PostgreSQL `NULL::unknown` and `CAST(NULL AS unknown)` now lower to a bare
  `NULL` for T-SQL/Fabric. Other unresolved `unknown` casts are rejected in
  strict mode instead of generating a cast to a nonexistent target type.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Shared, generated AST-child traversal infrastructure through the new internal
  `polyglot-sql-ast-derive` crate, including immutable and mutable child-slot
  metadata, path-aware traversal checks, and dedicated traversal benchmarks.
- Optional Rust-core semantic validation through `ValidationOptions.semantic`
  and `validate_with_dialect`, covering warnings W001-W004 for `SELECT *`,
  mixed aggregates without `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT` with `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`
  without `ORDER BY`. The same validation path is now exposed through Python,
  C FFI, Go, WASM, and TypeScript without changing schema-validation behavior.
- A machine-readable cross-language API capability contract with verification
  across Rust, Python, C FFI, Go, WASM, and TypeScript.
- Project-consistency tooling and Make targets for checking release versions,
  public dialect metadata, active documentation, the standalone Rust example,
  and generated API documentation.
- CI quality gates for Rust and TypeScript formatting, scoped Clippy checks,
  Biome linting, consistency checks, documentation builds, benchmark
  compilation, and TypeScript SDK coverage summaries and artifacts.
- Focused performance and allocation benchmarks for dialect construction, AST
  traversal, tokenization/parsing, Python concurrency, and native release
  profiles, with reproducible Make targets and a benchmark report.
- Regression coverage for the new T-SQL/Fabric strict-mode capability checks
  and rewrites, including regex aggregate filters, row-value membership,
  aggregate ordering, hypothetical-set aggregates, and supported control cases.

### Changed
- Cross-dialect normalization is now split into semantic modules for
  aggregates, collections, JSON, operators, scalar functions, statements,
  temporal expressions, and types while preserving the existing normalization
  pipeline and public API.
- Built-in dialects now share immutable tokenizer configurations. ASCII input
  uses a byte cursor, unchanged parser token text references one shared SQL
  source, and token guard statistics are collected during tokenization instead
  of requiring a second full scan; the public owned `Token` API is unchanged.
- Python native calls now execute directly while the GIL is detached instead
  of serializing through one global worker. Published Python artifacts use a
  dedicated `opt-level=2`/thin-LTO profile.
- Repository-built native artifacts now use the `opt-level=3` `native_release`
  profile. FFI/Go release artifacts use `opt-level=2` with thin LTO for higher
  query throughput while retaining unwind protection; WASM remains
  size-optimized.
- The benchmark comparison now uses the same production Python profile as
  published wheels.
- TypeScript now publishes one full WASM SDK containing all supported dialects;
  dialect-specific Rust/WASM builds remain available through Cargo features.
- Release metadata and active documentation now consistently use version
  `0.6.0` and canonical supported-dialect names rather than hard-coded dialect
  counts.

### Fixed
- Logical planner DAG construction now assigns globally unique preorder IDs to
  nested dependencies, includes every leaf node, and serializes complete plans
  through WASM. Previously ignored invalid-input WASM tests are active again.
- Strict PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric transpilation now rejects unsupported
  `NTH_VALUE`, `SCALE`, `TRIM_SCALE`, `MIN_SCALE`, `FACTORIAL`, and `PG_LSN`
  calls; `GROUPS`, value-offset `RANGE`, and `EXCLUDE` window frames; frames and
  window functions requiring a missing `ORDER BY`; `JOIN ... USING`, `NATURAL
  JOIN`, unsupported base/joined-table column alias lists, and qualified
  whole-row aggregate arguments such as `COUNT(alias.*)`.
- Multi-column PostgreSQL `GROUPING(...)` now maps to `GROUPING_ID(...)` for
  T-SQL/Fabric, `GROUP BY DISTINCT` grouping sets are expanded and deduplicated,
  and Fabric drops `ORDER BY` keys that become constant through single-level
  grouping analysis.
- PostgreSQL boolean aggregates used as window functions now keep `OVER` on
  the aggregate inside the outer `BIT` cast. Scalar `BIT` expressions and
  boolean literals are also normalized correctly in predicate contexts and
  nested joined-table conditions.
- `LAG` and `LEAD` arguments now receive recursive target transformations, so
  numeric casts retain their precision and scale.
- Nested T-SQL/Fabric `ORDER BY` clauses without a row bound now receive the
  required `OFFSET 0 ROWS`. Unordered inert zero/`NULL` offsets are removed,
  while retained offsets and `FETCH` clauses receive a neutral
  `ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)` when needed.
- PostgreSQL lateral joins that reference earlier comma-separated siblings now
  build an explicit `CROSS JOIN` product before `CROSS APPLY`/`OUTER APPLY`,
  keeping every correlated source visible to the APPLY right-hand expression.
- PostgreSQL row-value `IN (VALUES ...)` and `NOT IN (VALUES ...)` predicates
  now lower to `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` for T-SQL/Fabric, including scalar boolean
  contexts and null-aware `NOT IN` semantics. Strict mode rejects mismatched
  row and `VALUES` arities.
- T-SQL/Fabric ordering generation now disambiguates duplicate projected
  columns before adding null-ordering expressions. PostgreSQL `ORDER BY`
  clauses that are inert inside ordinary aggregates are removed, while window
  ordering and ordered `STRING_AGG` semantics remain intact.
- Strict PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric transpilation now rejects hypothetical-set
  `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `CUME_DIST`, and `PERCENT_RANK`; internal aggregate
  support functions such as `FLOAT8_*` and `BOOL*_STATEFUNC`; PostgreSQL array
  casts; `STRING_AGG` with `DISTINCT`; PostgreSQL collations; and date
  subtraction whose column type cannot be resolved safely.
- PostgreSQL `FROM ONLY` drops its unsupported inheritance modifier when
  targeting T-SQL/Fabric. `ANY_VALUE` lowers to `MAX` for T-SQL and remains
  native for Fabric.
- PostgreSQL numeric `TO_CHAR` format models now fail in strict T-SQL/Fabric
  transpilation instead of being mistaken for .NET format strings. Text-cast
  temporal format literals such as `'YYYY-MM-DD'::text` continue to lower to
  valid `FORMAT` expressions.

### Removed
- The unshipped TypeScript per-dialect package exports and build configuration;
  the supported npm surface is the full `@polyglot-sql/sdk` package.
- Duplicate TypeScript-only semantic validation rules, now that basic semantic
  validation is implemented consistently in the Rust core.

## [0.5.16] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Expanded strict-mode regression coverage for unsupported transpilation
  leftovers, including recursive CTEs, residual lateral joins, unsupported
  `UNNEST`/`EXPLODE` targets, duplicate-preserving set operations, lossy array
  aggregates, regex predicates, residual `FETCH WITH TIES` / `OVERLAPS` /
  `DATE_BIN`, PostgreSQL-only scalar functions, PostgreSQL JSON functions, and
  `maxUnsupported` option handling.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric rewrites across JSON
  operators and constructors, temporal functions, math/string functions,
  arrays, lateral joins, window frames, row-value subqueries, aggregate
  filters, ordered `STRING_AGG`, ordered-set percentiles, no-op limits,
  interval/date arithmetic, and `VALUES` set-operation operands.
- Regression coverage for structured PostgreSQL `PREPARE` / `EXECUTE`
  parsing and PostgreSQL replication protocol command fallbacks.
- Parser regression coverage for `TIMESTAMPTZ '...'` and
  `TIMESTAMPTZ(n) '...'` typed literals in generic, DuckDB, and PostgreSQL
  parsing paths.

### Changed
- Fabric and T-SQL now share more PostgreSQL compatibility rewrites while
  preserving Fabric-specific type mappings such as `NVARCHAR` to `VARCHAR`.

### Fixed
- PostgreSQL JSON extraction operators, path operators, JSON constructors,
  `json_agg` / `jsonb_agg`, and scalar `jsonb_array_elements(...)` projections
  now transpile to valid T-SQL/Fabric JSON functions such as `JSON_VALUE`,
  `JSON_QUERY`, `JSON_OBJECT`, `JSON_ARRAYAGG`, and `OPENJSON` where a safe
  mapping exists.
- Strict PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric transpilation now rejects unsupported JSON
  row shapes, array literals/subscripts/functions, PostgreSQL-only scalar
  functions such as `GCD`, `LCM`, `ERF`, `QUOTE_LITERAL`, `AGE`, and
  `PG_TYPEOF`, unsupported statistical aggregates, residual array `ANY`
  semantics, and scalar interval casts instead of emitting target SQL that
  would fail at runtime.
- PostgreSQL regex and `SIMILAR TO` expressions now either lower to supported
  T-SQL/Fabric predicate forms for compatible patterns or fail in strict mode
  for unsupported SQL-regex patterns.
- PostgreSQL temporal rewrites targeting T-SQL/Fabric now handle current
  temporal niladics, `EXTRACT` / `date_part`, typed-text `date_part` fields,
  `date_trunc`, simple `date_bin` buckets, `to_timestamp`, `to_date`,
  `to_char`, and `format(...)` string interpolation with valid target
  signatures or strict-mode rejection for unsupported forms.
- PostgreSQL math, string, type, and operator rewrites targeting T-SQL/Fabric
  now cover `LOG`/`LN`/`LOG10`, `DIV`, `CBRT`, `REPEAT`, `CHR`, `OVERLAY`,
  `BTRIM`, `MD5`, `OCTET_LENGTH`, `BIT_LENGTH`, `TO_HEX`, hex `ENCODE`,
  simple `TO_NUMBER`, approximate numeric casts, function-style type casts,
  `ROUND(x)`, bitwise XOR `#`, absolute-value `@`, and `MOD(...)`.
- PostgreSQL UUID generator functions such as `gen_random_uuid()`,
  `uuid_generate_v4()`, and `uuidv4()` now map to `NEWID()` for T-SQL/Fabric.
- PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric query-shape rewrites now strip unsupported CTE
  materialization hints, hoist nested CTEs from derived subqueries, map
  supported lateral joins to `CROSS APPLY` / `OUTER APPLY`, preserve valid
  null ordering and `DISTINCT ON` behavior through wrapper queries, handle
  positional `ORDER BY` safely, and keep recursive CTE output valid by omitting
  the unsupported `RECURSIVE` keyword.
- PostgreSQL row-value `IN` and equality subquery comparisons now rewrite to
  `EXISTS` predicates for T-SQL/Fabric when arity and projection shapes are
  safe, including casted and wrapped subquery projections.
- PostgreSQL boolean and null-safe comparison rewrites targeting T-SQL/Fabric
  now distinguish predicate contexts from scalar contexts, materializing scalar
  boolean results as `BIT` values while keeping predicates executable.
- PostgreSQL aggregate filters, ordered `STRING_AGG`, typed string-aggregate
  separators, and grouped `PERCENTILE_CONT` / `PERCENTILE_DISC` ordered-set
  aggregates now lower to valid T-SQL/Fabric forms; unsupported `MODE() WITHIN
  GROUP` fails in strict mode.
- PostgreSQL `VALUES` statements and `VALUES` set-operation operands now wrap
  as derived tables for T-SQL/Fabric, avoiding invalid top-level or set-operand
  `VALUES` SQL.
- PostgreSQL `LIMIT NULL`, `LIMIT ALL`, and `LIMIT (NULL)` are omitted for
  T-SQL/Fabric, offset-only queries keep a valid `OFFSET ... ROWS` shape, and
  `FETCH FIRST ... WITH TIES` maps to `TOP ... WITH TIES` where supported.
- PostgreSQL date/date and date/integer arithmetic now maps to `DATEDIFF` or
  day-based `DATEADD`, and common interval arithmetic including abbreviated
  time and month units maps to target `DATEADD` calls.
- The parser now accepts `TIMESTAMPTZ '...'` and `TIMESTAMPTZ(n) '...'` typed
  literals and normalizes them to explicit timestamp-with-time-zone casts,
  matching the behavior already available through explicit `CAST(...)` and
  PostgreSQL `::TIMESTAMPTZ` casts.

## [0.5.15] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL-only scalar and JSON functions when
  targeting T-SQL/Fabric strict mode, including `LPAD`, `RPAD`, `SPLIT_PART`,
  `INITCAP`, `TO_JSON`, `TO_JSONB`, `JSONB_AGG`, and `JSONB_OBJECT_AGG`.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL `SELECT DISTINCT ... ORDER BY` null
  ordering when targeting T-SQL/Fabric, including selected expressions,
  selected aliases, target-default null ordering, and unsupported unselected
  expressions.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL boolean tests targeting T-SQL/Fabric,
  including `IS TRUE`, `IS FALSE`, `IS NOT TRUE`, `IS NOT FALSE`, and
  `IS UNKNOWN` in predicate and scalar-value contexts.
- Regression coverage for bare boolean predicates targeting T-SQL/Fabric in
  `WHERE`, `HAVING`, `CASE WHEN`, `JOIN ... ON`, nested subqueries, and CTE
  bodies.
- Regression coverage for unsupported `EXCEPT ALL` and `INTERSECT ALL` when
  targeting T-SQL/Fabric strict mode.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL positional `ORDER BY` ordinals targeting
  T-SQL/Fabric, including standalone selects and wrapped set operations.

### Fixed
- Strict PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric transpilation now rejects known
  PostgreSQL-only scalar and JSON functions instead of returning target SQL
  that the destination dialect cannot execute.
- `SELECT DISTINCT ... ORDER BY` with emulated null ordering now generates a
  valid T-SQL/Fabric wrapper query that projects stable internal sort keys,
  avoiding invalid `ORDER BY` expressions that are not present in the
  `DISTINCT` select list.
- PostgreSQL boolean tests now preserve three-valued logic when transpiling to
  T-SQL/Fabric: negated `IS TRUE` / `IS FALSE` predicates retain `NULL` rows,
  scalar boolean-test outputs are materialized as definite `BIT` values, and
  predicate operands are not compared directly to integer literals.
- Fabric now applies the same bare boolean predicate coercion as T-SQL, and
  the boolean coercion transform now reaches `JOIN ... ON`, nested subqueries,
  CTE bodies, and set-operation branches without inheriting unrelated T-SQL
  preprocessing behavior.
- T-SQL/Fabric strict mode now rejects `EXCEPT ALL` and `INTERSECT ALL` as
  unsupported duplicate-preserving set operations while keeping plain
  `EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` valid.
- Positional `ORDER BY` ordinals targeting T-SQL/Fabric no longer produce
  invalid constant null-ordering CASE expressions such as
  `CASE WHEN 1 IS NULL ...`; default mode preserves the ordinal and strict mode
  reports unsupported positional null-ordering simulation.

## [0.5.14] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL positional bind parameters inside
  T-SQL/Fabric predicate expressions, ensuring `$1`, `$2`, ... are rendered as
  executable `@P1`, `@P2`, ... placeholders outside simple projection lists.

### Fixed
- PostgreSQL `$n` positional bind parameters now render as T-SQL/Fabric
  `@Pn` placeholders instead of invalid `$n` syntax when transpiling to those
  dialects.

## [0.5.13] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Configurable complexity guards for recursion-heavy parse, transpile,
  transform, and generation paths, including limits for SQL input size, token
  count, AST node count, AST depth, parenthesis nesting, and function-call
  nesting.
- `TranspileOptions.complexityGuard` / `complexity_guard` support across Rust,
  C FFI JSON options, WASM/TypeScript, and Go, allowing callers to raise or
  disable individual guard limits for trusted inputs.
- Regression coverage for deeply nested unary functions such as PostgreSQL
  `abs(abs(...))` when transpiling to Fabric, including guard override coverage
  through Rust, C FFI, Go option encoding, and TypeScript typings.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL lateral joins targeting T-SQL and Fabric,
  including parenthesized join groups, comma-style `LATERAL` sources,
  non-trivial `ON` predicates, column alias preservation, and strict-mode
  rejection of residual unsupported lateral joins.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL function-style type casts targeting
  T-SQL and Fabric, including `numeric(...)`, `int4(...)`, `float8(...)`,
  `bool(...)`, `text(...)`, and unsafe strict-mode residuals.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL scalar-array membership with outer
  array casts targeting T-SQL and Fabric, including PostgreSQL
  `pg_get_querydef` / ruleutils-style `= ANY((ARRAY[...])::type[])` output.

### Fixed
- Excessively nested function-call inputs now fail with a regular
  `E_GUARD_FUNCTION_NESTING_DEPTH_EXCEEDED` error instead of risking stack
  overflow or process aborts during parsing/transpilation.
- Moderate nested unary functions now parse more reliably through stack-growth
  protection and a lightweight parser fast path for common unary functions such
  as `ABS`, `SQRT`, `LOWER`, and `UPPER`.
- AST-depth guarding now preserves existing behavior for deep commentless
  `AND` / `OR` connector chains that are generated iteratively, avoiding
  regressions in optimizer and generator stress tests.
- Minimal `semantic` / `openlineage` feature builds no longer require the
  generator module for pivot suffix helpers.
- PostgreSQL `JOIN LATERAL` and `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` inside parenthesized
  `FROM` groups now transpile to valid T-SQL/Fabric `CROSS APPLY` and
  `OUTER APPLY` instead of emitting unsupported `JOIN LATERAL` SQL.
- PostgreSQL comma-style `FROM t, LATERAL (...)` now maps to T-SQL/Fabric
  `CROSS APPLY`, and lateral joins with non-trivial `ON` predicates now push
  the predicate into a filtered APPLY right-hand derived table while preserving
  the user-facing lateral alias.
- PostgreSQL function-style type casts now transpile to real T-SQL/Fabric
  `CAST(...)` expressions instead of invalid type-keyword function calls such
  as `NUMERIC(...)`, `INT4(...)`, or `FLOAT8(...)`; strict mode now rejects
  residual unsafe type-name calls that cannot be safely converted.
- PostgreSQL `= ANY((ARRAY[...])::type[])` scalar-array membership now
  transpiles to valid T-SQL/Fabric `IN (...)` predicates with the outer array
  element type pushed down to the individual values, and strict mode now
  rejects residual non-subquery `ANY` expressions for T-SQL/Fabric instead of
  returning invalid SQL.

## [0.5.12] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Regression coverage for Trino/Presto `CREATE VIEW` parsing with `COMMENT`
  before `SECURITY`.
- Regression coverage for T-SQL `VARBINARY(MAX)`, `VARCHAR(MAX)`, and
  `NVARCHAR(MAX)` types across standalone datatype parsing, `CREATE TABLE`,
  `CAST`, and identity transpilation.
- Regression coverage for updated ClickHouse `* LIKE` / `* ILIKE` wildcard
  filters with trailing `EXCEPT` modifiers and nested wildcard filters inside
  `tuple(...)`.

### Changed
- Rust verification fixtures now track SQLGlot `v30.12.0` and ClickHouse
  `v26.6.1.1193-stable`.

### Fixed
- Trino/Presto `CREATE VIEW` parsing now accepts documented `COMMENT ...
  SECURITY ...` clause order while preserving the previously accepted
  `SECURITY ... COMMENT ...` order.
- T-SQL datatype parsing now accepts `VARBINARY(MAX)` consistently with the
  existing `VARCHAR(MAX)` and `NVARCHAR(MAX)` handling, so casts and DDL no
  longer fail with `Expected number`.
- SQLGlot identity verification compatibility for updated dialect fixtures,
  including DuckDB/PostgreSQL array contained-by operators, Databricks bracketed
  JSON path string keys, PostgreSQL JSON path `@?` predicates, SQLite ordered
  `ON CONFLICT` targets, BigQuery adjacent string literal comments, PostgreSQL
  function return/property normalization, and Snowflake `UNDROP`,
  `IDENTIFIER(...)()` calls, and inline table/view options.
- ClickHouse parser and normalized round-trip compatibility for updated
  fixtures, including escaped backticks in quoted identifiers, descending
  expressions inside table-property `ORDER BY (...)`, wildcard
  `LIKE`/`ILIKE ... EXCEPT` filters, nested wildcard filters in `tuple(...)`,
  and stable raw `EXPLAIN` subquery normalization.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Regression coverage for strict-mode rejection of PostgreSQL regex predicates
  when targeting Fabric or T-SQL.
- Regression coverage for T-SQL/Fabric `DATEPART` weekday, ISO week, and
  timezone-offset date-part generation.

### Fixed
- Strict Fabric/T-SQL transpilation now rejects remaining regular-expression
  predicates such as `SIMILAR TO`, `~`, `!~`, `~*`, `!~*`, and `REGEXP_LIKE`
  instead of reporting success with unsupported target SQL.
- T-SQL/Fabric `DATEPART` generation now maps internal canonical date parts
  back to valid target names such as `WEEKDAY`, `ISO_WEEK`, and `TZOFFSET`
  instead of emitting unsupported names like `DAYOFWEEK`.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Regression coverage for partial-schema `analyze_query` and
  `lineage_with_schema` calls across Rust core, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python,
  and Go.
- Regression coverage for ordered `STRING_AGG`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, and `LISTAGG`
  transpilation to DuckDB.

### Fixed
- `analyze_query` and `lineage_with_schema` now tolerate partial schemas by
  resolving known columns while preserving unknown columns as best-effort
  lineage facts instead of aborting the analysis with `Unknown column`.
- DuckDB transpilation now emits ordered `STRING_AGG`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, and
  `LISTAGG` as `LISTAGG(expr, separator ORDER BY ...)` instead of the
  unsupported `WITHIN GROUP` form.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Regression coverage for schema-backed `analyze_query` lineage through nested
  set-operation derived tables, CTEs, and `UNNEST` output aliases across Rust
  core, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python, and Go.

### Fixed
- `analyze_query` now resolves aliased and parenthesized query-like sources when
  deriving source output columns, so schema-backed nested `UNION` / `INTERSECT`
  / `EXCEPT` relations can still trace projections back to their physical input
  columns.
- `analyze_query` now recognizes `UNNEST`, lateral, and lateral-view virtual
  output aliases during schema-backed qualification, including both relation
  aliases and explicit output column aliases such as `UNNEST(t.arr) AS u(i)`.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Regression coverage for nested set-operation derived table lineage, scalar
  subqueries inside expression wrappers, same-select alias references,
  pivot/unpivot alias columns, and semi/anti join source inference across Rust
  core, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python, and Go.

### Fixed
- Lineage now registers aliased query-like derived relations such as nested
  `UNION` expressions in `FROM`, so output columns trace back to each physical
  source table instead of stopping at the derived relation.
- Scalar subqueries wrapped in expressions such as `CASE`, `COALESCE`, `CAST`,
  `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`, and `EXISTS` now contribute their source-column
  lineage.
- Same-select alias references now resolve through earlier projection
  expressions before column qualification, avoiding unresolved or incorrect
  physical-column attribution.
- Pivot and unpivot lineage now preserves alias column lists and maps renamed or
  generated outputs back to implicit source columns and aggregate input columns.
- Star and source inference now ignores semi/anti join right-hand inputs,
  preventing non-output join sources from making schema-less star lineage
  ambiguous.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Regression coverage for recursive CTE, query-wrapper, set-operation,
  scalar-subquery, window, pivot, and unpivot lineage across Rust core,
  C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python, and Go.

### Changed
- Rust verification fixtures now track SQLGlot `v30.11.0` and ClickHouse
  `v26.5.2.39-stable`.

### Fixed
- Lineage now analyzes query-bearing wrappers such as `PREPARE`, CTAS,
  `CREATE VIEW`, and `INSERT ... SELECT` through their inner query instead of
  rejecting them as non-`SELECT` expressions.
- Recursive CTE lineage now terminates at the base case and preserves CTE
  provenance for recursive references instead of recursing indefinitely.
- Lineage now resolves parent CTEs through set-operation branches and scalar
  subqueries, so downstream nodes can trace back to the original base tables.
- Window-function lineage now includes dependencies from `PARTITION BY`,
  window `ORDER BY`, named window definitions, ordered aggregates, and
  `WITHIN GROUP` ordering.
- Pivot and unpivot lineage now maps generated output/value columns back to
  the underlying input columns.
- SQLGlot identity verification compatibility for updated dialect fixtures,
  including BigQuery `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table qualification, ClickHouse
  variadic `xor(...)` and view schemas with `NOT NULL`, Databricks two-argument
  `DATEADD`, native `GET_JSON_OBJECT`, `CLUSTER BY NONE`, and collated string
  casts.
- Parser/generator round-tripping for newer dialect fixture cases, including
  MySQL `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN`, Oracle `TO_NUMBER(... DEFAULT ... ON
  CONVERSION ERROR)`, PostgreSQL `CREATE TYPE` variants, collated data types,
  PostgreSQL `<<->>` operators, T-SQL `FOR BROWSE`, and `NOT LIKE` / `NOT ILIKE`
  `ANY` and `ALL` forms.
- ClickHouse normalized round-tripping for updated table-function CTAS shapes,
  projection indexes, keyword CTE names such as `interval`, comma-style
  `OVERLAY(...)`, and newer parser tolerance cases from the ClickHouse corpus.
- Exasol transpilation now qualifies select-list aliases in `WHERE` and
  `HAVING` predicates with `LOCAL.<alias>`, matching Exasol's alias reference
  semantics.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Regression coverage for schema-less CTE star passthrough lineage across Rust
  core, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python, and Go.

### Fixed
- Lineage now traces schema-less CTE `SELECT *` passthroughs when a single
  unambiguous source exists, so projections and aggregates such as
  `WITH c AS (SELECT * FROM t) SELECT SUM(c.x)` resolve back to `t.x` instead
  of stopping at the CTE column.
- The schema-less star fallback remains conservative for ambiguous multi-source
  stars and unresolved quoted table references, preserving quoted CTE/table case
  semantics.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Regression coverage for T-SQL `0x...` hex literals and nested
  query-analysis transform function detection.

### Fixed
- T-SQL `0x...` hex/binary literals now tokenize, parse, transpile, and
  round-trip in expressions such as predicates, `INSERT` values, and arithmetic
  expressions.
- T-SQL/Fabric generation now preserves hex string literals as native `0x...`
  values instead of emitting SQL-standard `x'...'` hex string syntax.
- `ProjectionFact.transformFunction` now reports a sole nested transform
  function inside passthrough wrappers such as `COALESCE(...)` and
  `CAST(... AS ...)`, while leaving ambiguous projections with multiple
  transform functions unset.
- Playground JSON tree panels now keep a bounded height and scroll correctly in
  the AST Explorer and Lineage JSON views.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- `RelationFact` now includes nullable `catalog`, `schema`, and `table` fields
  for physical table relations while preserving the qualified `name` string.
- `ProjectionFact` now includes optional `transformFunction` /
  `transform_function` metadata for function-like projections, including the
  function name, literal arguments, and column arguments.
- AST transform helpers now support setting `ORDER BY` across Rust,
  C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python, and Go.
- C FFI, Python, and Go now expose AST transform helpers for setting `LIMIT`
  and `OFFSET`, matching the existing TypeScript SDK helper surface.
- Regression coverage for set-operation AST transforms, JOIN table-node
  discovery, nested dot-access builders, AST JSON compatibility, and
  function-projection facts across Rust, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python, and Go.

### Changed
- Public AST JSON boundaries now use the shared compatibility deserializer for
  generation and AST transforms, so SDK-provided JSON shapes are normalized
  consistently before deserialization.

### Fixed
- `set_limit` / `setLimit` and `set_offset` / `setOffset` now apply to outer
  `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` results instead of no-oping on set
  operations.
- TypeScript SDK `getTables(node)` now returns table expression nodes from JOIN
  operands instead of only the locally traversable table nodes.
- Rust and TypeScript builder output for `col("a.b.c")` now uses nested dot
  access (`a.b.c`) instead of treating `a.b` as a single quoted table
  qualifier.
- AST JSON inputs now accept the known legacy/unit-variant compatibility shapes
  at public API boundaries, including empty-object null payloads and `IS NULL`
  shorthand values.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `QueryAnalysis` now includes `cteFacts` / `cte_facts` for top-level CTE names,
  declared columns, original body SQL, and output columns.
- `QueryAnalysis` now includes `starProjections` / `star_projections` to retain
  provenance for original top-level `*` and `table.*` projections after schema
  expansion.
- `ProjectionFact` now includes conservative `nullability` classification:
  `non_null`, `nullable`, or `unknown`.
- Regression coverage for CTE facts, star projection provenance, and projection
  nullability across Rust, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, Python, and Go.
- Regression coverage for `baseTables` discovery inside inline derived tables
  and derived-table set operations.

### Changed
- Validation schema documentation now explicitly covers the accepted JSON shape,
  including the `type` column key and nullability/constraint metadata.

### Fixed
- `QueryAnalysis.baseTables` now descends into inline derived tables
  (`FROM (SELECT ...) AS alias`), including derived-table set operations, so
  physical backing tables are reported consistently with CTE-backed queries.
- T-SQL parsing now accepts structured `SET IDENTITY_INSERT <table> ON|OFF`
  statements and round-trips them without falling back to an opaque command.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `QueryAnalysis` now includes `baseTables` / `base_tables`, a deduplicated
  list of transitive physical table dependencies collected across root queries,
  CTEs, derived tables, scalar subqueries, and set-operation branches.
- TypeScript SDK `analyzeQuery` now accepts a dialect shorthand argument such as
  `analyzeQuery(sql, Dialect.DuckDB)` in addition to the existing options
  object.
- Regression coverage for query-analysis aliases, qualified star expansion,
  schema-driven star expansion, aggregate classification, precise type hints,
  and transitive base-table reporting across Rust, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript,
  Python, and Go.

### Changed
- Compact query analysis now preserves parseable detailed validation-schema
  type strings such as `DECIMAL(10,2)` for projection `typeHint` values while
  leaving schema-aware validation's broad type-family behavior unchanged.
- Query-analysis documentation now distinguishes direct visible `relations`
  from transitive physical `baseTables` across Rust, Python, C FFI,
  WASM/TypeScript, and Go.

### Fixed
- Physical table aliases such as `orders AS o` are now preserved in
  query-analysis upstream references as `sourceAlias` while keeping the physical
  table identity as `orders`.
- Qualified star projections such as `o.*` now expand and trace only the
  matching source instead of all sources in the query.
- Schema-aware analysis now resolves columns qualified by query aliases before
  type annotation, so aliased table references keep correct upstream tables and
  type hints.
- Typed aggregate AST variants such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`,
  `COUNT_IF`, `SUM_IF`, `STRING_AGG`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, and `LISTAGG` are now
  classified as `aggregation` transforms in compact query analysis.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Standalone data-type parsing and generation convenience APIs across Rust,
  Python, C FFI, WASM/TypeScript, and Go, including Rust
  `parse_data_type` / `generate_data_type`, Python `parse_data_type` and
  `parse_one(..., into=polyglot_sql.DataType)`, FFI
  `polyglot_parse_data_type` / `polyglot_generate_data_type`, TypeScript
  `parseDataType` / `generateDataType`, and Go
  `ParseDataType` / `GenerateDataType`.
- Compact query-analysis convenience APIs across Rust, Python, C FFI,
  WASM/TypeScript, and Go, returning high-level query facts such as shape,
  projections, relations, CTEs, set-operation branches, and upstream column
  references without requiring callers to consume the full AST or lineage graph.
- Optional schema-aware query analysis that qualifies references and includes
  inferred projection types when validation schema metadata is supplied.
- PostgreSQL replication protocol command parsing for `BASE_BACKUP`,
  `CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT`, `DROP_REPLICATION_SLOT`, `IDENTIFY_SYSTEM`,
  `READ_REPLICATION_SLOT`, `START_REPLICATION`, and `TIMELINE_HISTORY`.
- Regression coverage and documentation for the new data-type and query-analysis
  APIs across the Rust core and native SDKs.

### Fixed
- Snowflake `DATEDIFF`, `DATE_DIFF`, `TIMEDIFF`, and `TIMESTAMPDIFF`
  identity generation now preserves Snowflake's start/end argument order in
  direct, nested, aggregate, `CASE`, and `ORDER BY` contexts.
- T-SQL `SET STATISTICS TIME|IO|XML|PROFILE ON|OFF` statements now parse and
  round-trip as command statements, including comma-separated forms such as
  `SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON`, while preserving structured parsing for simple
  options like `SET NOCOUNT ON`.
- PostgreSQL replication protocol commands now parse and generate instead of
  failing on command-style syntax such as
  `CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT ... LOGICAL ...` and `START_REPLICATION ...`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Strict unsupported-transpilation mode via `TranspileOptions.unsupported_level`,
  `TranspileOptions.max_unsupported`, and the `TranspileOptions::strict()`
  helper, with `UnsupportedLevel` re-exported from the Rust crate root and
  serialized as lower-case option values.
- Strict unsupported-transpilation options across C FFI, WASM, Python, Go, and
  the TypeScript SDK, including Python `unsupported_level` /
  `max_unsupported`, Go `UnsupportedLevel` constants, and TypeScript
  `TranspileOptions`.
- Regression coverage for strict unsupported transpilation in Rust core, C FFI,
  WASM, Python, Go option serialization, and TypeScript SDK type/API tests.
- Lineage and scope support for table-generating virtual sources beyond
  BigQuery `UNNEST`, including PostgreSQL/Presto/Trino `UNNEST` aliases,
  Spark/Hive `LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE`, and Snowflake `LATERAL FLATTEN`.

### Changed
- Transpilation now passes full `TranspileOptions` into the target generator,
  so generator unsupported diagnostics honor caller-selected
  `unsupported_level` and `max_unsupported` settings.
- Strict unsupported checks run after source normalization and target rewrites,
  allowing successful rewrites to proceed while rejecting only known unsupported
  constructs that still remain in the final output AST.

### Fixed
- Strict unsupported mode now rejects known lossy or unsupported target output
  such as Fabric/Hive recursive CTEs, remaining T-SQL/Fabric `LATERAL`, target
  unsupported `UNNEST`/`EXPLODE`, lossy `ARRAY_AGG`, and PostgreSQL-specific
  `JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT` / `TO_TSVECTOR` calls when the target dialect cannot
  safely represent them.
- Default transpilation remains permissive for the same constructs, preserving
  existing behavior unless callers explicitly opt into strict unsupported
  handling.
- Lineage for unqualified columns emitted by table-generating functions now
  resolves to the matching virtual source node and preserves downstream
  dependencies on the real table columns feeding the virtual source.
- Snowflake `LATERAL FLATTEN` lineage now treats `FLATTEN` output columns such
  as `value` as virtual source columns and traces them back to the referenced
  input expression.
- Column-reference collection now follows `LATERAL`, `LATERAL VIEW`, and JSON
  extraction expressions used inside virtual table-generating sources.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- Lineage nodes now expose `source_kind` and optional `source_alias` metadata
  across Rust core, C FFI, WASM, Python, Go, and the TypeScript SDK so clients
  can distinguish physical tables, CTEs, derived tables, virtual sources, and
  unresolved sources.
- Regression coverage for BigQuery `UNNEST` lineage metadata across the native
  wrappers and SDKs, including Go and TypeScript SDK assertions.

### Changed
- OpenLineage column lineage now ignores purely virtual terminal sources such
  as standalone BigQuery `UNNEST(...) AS alias` values instead of emitting
  synthetic physical input fields, while table-backed `UNNEST(t.items)` still
  resolves to the real source column.
- PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL and PostgreSQL-to-Fabric transpilation now materializes
  scalar boolean value expressions as `CASE` values in projection, grouping,
  ordering, and window contexts while preserving predicate contexts such as
  `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
- The `test-go-integration` Makefile target now resolves the platform-specific
  FFI library name through an explicit shell variable before running Go SDK
  integration tests.

### Fixed
- BigQuery `UNNEST(...) AS alias` lineage now uses stable synthetic virtual
  source names such as `_0`/`_1`, preserves the user-written alias separately,
  and avoids treating real tables with the same name as virtual sources.
- PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL and PostgreSQL-to-Fabric transpilation now omits the
  unsupported `RECURSIVE` keyword from recursive CTE output.
- PostgreSQL `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`, `JOIN LATERAL`, `INNER JOIN LATERAL`, and
  `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` now transpile to T-SQL/Fabric `CROSS APPLY` or
  `OUTER APPLY` when the join has no meaningful join predicate, and Fabric now
  preserves native `APPLY` joins during generation.
- T-SQL and Fabric output now strips unsupported window frames from
  ranking/navigation window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `NTILE`,
  `LEAD`, and `LAG`; framed named windows are inlined only for the affected
  function so aggregate uses of the same named window remain unchanged.
- PostgreSQL `MOD(a, b)` now lowers to the T-SQL/Fabric `%` operator and keeps
  compound arguments parenthesized to preserve precedence.
- PostgreSQL `POSITION(substr IN str)` and `STRPOS(str, substr)` now transpile
  to Fabric `CHARINDEX(substr, str)`.
- PostgreSQL row-value `IN` subqueries such as `(a, b) IN (SELECT x, y ...)`
  now transpile to correlated `EXISTS` predicates for T-SQL and Fabric when the
  arity matches, while `NOT IN` and mismatched arity cases are left unchanged.
- Fabric now maps unqualified PostgreSQL `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` casts to
  `DECIMAL(38, 10)` while preserving explicit precision and scale.
- PostgreSQL statistical aggregates `STDDEV_SAMP`, `STDDEV_POP`, `VAR_SAMP`,
  and `VAR_POP` now map to the corresponding T-SQL/Fabric function names
  `STDEV`, `STDEVP`, `VAR`, and `VARP`.
- PostgreSQL boolean aggregates `BOOL_AND`, `BOOL_OR`, and `EVERY`, including
  filtered variants, now transpile to null-preserving T-SQL/Fabric `MIN`/`MAX`
  `CASE` aggregates cast to `BIT`.
- T-SQL and Fabric aggregate `FILTER (WHERE ...)` clauses now transpile to
  conditional aggregate inputs for counts, distinct counts, ordinary
  aggregates, and window aggregates.
- PostgreSQL `STRING_AGG(value, sep ORDER BY ...)` now emits T-SQL/Fabric
  `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)`, including NULL-ordering emulation where
  needed.
- PostgreSQL `BPCHAR` casts, double-colon casts, and DDL column definitions now
  normalize to `CHAR` for T-SQL and Fabric.
- PostgreSQL `= ANY(ARRAY[...])` and `= ANY((...))` predicates now transpile to
  `IN (...)` for T-SQL and Fabric, with empty arrays lowering to an always
  false predicate.
- PostgreSQL-to-Fabric and PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL transpilation now attaches
  trailing set-operation `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET` clauses to the
  outer `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT` result instead of the right-hand operand.
- Fabric and T-SQL set operations that need row limiting or NULL-ordering
  emulation are now wrapped in an outer query before applying `ORDER BY` /
  `TOP` / `OFFSET ... FETCH`, avoiding invalid `CASE WHEN ... IS NULL` sort
  keys inside the set-operation `ORDER BY`.
- Set-operation `ORDER BY` expressions now participate in cross-dialect
  NULL-ordering normalization, preserving PostgreSQL NULL sort semantics when
  transpiling to Fabric or T-SQL.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Structured PostgreSQL/generic prepared statement support with a new
  `Prepare` AST node for `PREPARE name [(type, ...)] AS statement`.
- PostgreSQL-style prepared statement execution arguments on `Execute` nodes,
  allowing `EXECUTE name(...)` to parse and round-trip without falling back to
  opaque command text.
- Regression coverage for prepared statement parse/generate/source-table flows
  across Rust, C FFI, WASM, Python, and the TypeScript SDK.

### Fixed
- Lineage, source-table extraction, traversal, scope analysis, and OpenLineage
  output now inspect the body of structured `PREPARE` statements.
- BigQuery `UNNEST(...) AS alias` sources now participate in lineage and
  OpenLineage column lineage, avoiding empty field lineage for projections such
  as `SELECT date_val AS week_start FROM UNNEST(...) AS date_val`.
- Python bindings now expose the new `Prepare` expression subclass in the
  native dispatcher, package exports, and type stubs.
- Documentation builds no longer fail on TypeDoc analysis of the TypeScript SDK
  manual WASM loader internals.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- TypeScript SDK manual WASM loader entry point at
  `@polyglot-sql/sdk/manual`, allowing bundlers such as esbuild to initialize
  the SDK with an explicitly imported WASM URL.
- Public TypeScript SDK WASM asset export at
  `@polyglot-sql/sdk/polyglot_sql.wasm`, published as
  `dist/polyglot_sql.wasm`.
- SDK bundler smoke coverage for esbuild, package export resolution, Node ESM,
  and CommonJS loading.

### Changed
- TypeScript SDK builds are now split into browser/default ESM, Node ESM,
  CommonJS, CDN ESM, and manual-loader artifacts so each runtime uses an
  appropriate WASM loading path.
- SDK, playground, and CI build flows now generate both wasm-bindgen bundler
  and web wrappers, verify the renamed WASM artifact set, and run the bundler
  smoke checks.
- TypeScript SDK documentation now includes explicit bundler guidance for Vite,
  esbuild, Next.js/webpack, Node ESM, CommonJS, and CDN/self-hosted usage.

### Fixed
- Browser/default TypeScript SDK bundles no longer include Node `node:fs` /
  `node:url` compatibility code, fixing browser bundlers that reject Node
  built-ins.
- esbuild users can now bundle without manually copying opaque SDK internals by
  importing the documented `polyglot_sql.wasm` asset and using the manual
  loader entry.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-23

### Changed
- `DropIndex.name` now uses the existing `TableRef` AST shape instead of a
  flattened `Identifier`, preserving qualified index targets and per-part
  quoted identifier metadata.
- The `semantic` Cargo feature no longer implies `generate`, so semantic-only
  Rust builds can compile without pulling in SQL generation.

### Fixed
- PostgreSQL `DROP INDEX` generation now preserves quoted mixed-case index
  names, including identity transpilation such as
  `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "idx_tokenKey__pb_users_auth_"`.
- SQLite-to-PostgreSQL transpilation now converts backtick-quoted `DROP INDEX`
  names to PostgreSQL double-quoted identifiers instead of emitting an
  unquoted, lowercased-by-PostgreSQL name.
- Qualified quoted `DROP INDEX` targets such as `"public"."IdxName"` now
  round-trip without losing quote state on individual name parts.
- `openlineage` and `semantic` feature combinations without `generate` now
  compile; default/full builds continue to emit the same generated SQL
  transformation descriptions as before.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Official Go SDK at `packages/go`, published as the nested Go module
  `github.com/tobilg/polyglot/packages/go`.
- PureGo-based Go bindings over the native `polyglot-sql-ffi` shared library,
  with explicit client lifecycle management and no cgo or runtime native
  library downloads by default.
- Go SDK APIs for transpilation, formatting, optimization, generation,
  validation, dialect listing, parsing/tokenization, AST diff, table
  transforms, lineage/source-table extraction, and OpenLineage payload
  generation.
- Go SDK typed option/result structs, default-client helpers, error wrapping,
  native library path resolution, FFI layout checks, unit tests, integration
  tests, and setup documentation.
- C FFI OpenLineage exports:
  `polyglot_openlineage_column_lineage`,
  `polyglot_openlineage_job_event`, and
  `polyglot_openlineage_run_event`.
- Cargo capability feature gates for `polyglot-sql`: `generate`, `transpile`,
  `builder`, `ast-tools`, `semantic`, `openlineage`, `diff`, `planner`, and
  `time`.
- Documented parser-only Rust builds via `default-features = false`.
- Makefile targets for Go SDK builds/tests and Rust feature-gate verification:
  `build-go`, `test-go`, `test-go-integration`, and
  `test-rust-feature-gates`.

### Changed
- The default Rust feature set continues to expose the full existing API, while
  optional capability groups now support smaller parser-only or selected-feature
  builds.
- `polyglot-sql-wasm` now explicitly opts into the full core capability set so
  existing JavaScript/WASM exports remain available with the new core feature
  gates.
- Release automation now verifies the Go SDK against the release-built FFI
  artifact and creates matching nested Go module tags such as
  `packages/go/v0.4.0`.
- Version bump helpers now update the Go SDK runtime version constant.

### Fixed
- SQLite-source transpilation now converts double-quoted column defaults such
  as `DEFAULT "base"`, `DEFAULT "[]"`, and `DEFAULT "{}"` into string
  literals for non-SQLite targets, fixing invalid PostgreSQL output while
  preserving SQLite identity output.

## [0.3.12] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- OpenLineage-compatible lineage payload generation in the Rust core via the
  new `polyglot_sql::openlineage` module. The new helpers produce standalone
  `columnLineage` dataset facets plus inferred input/output datasets, and can
  also build OpenLineage `JobEvent` and `RunEvent` JSON payloads.
- OpenLineage column lineage support for `SELECT`, `INSERT ... SELECT`, and
  `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, including dataset namespace/mapping options,
  target-column remapping for `INSERT INTO target(col) SELECT ...`, table alias
  resolution, direct/transformation/aggregation classification, and optional
  schema facet generation from validation schema metadata.
- WASM exports for OpenLineage payload generation:
  `openlineage_column_lineage`, `openlineage_job_event`, and
  `openlineage_run_event`.
- TypeScript SDK helpers and types:
  `openLineageColumnLineage`, `openLineageJobEvent`, `openLineageRunEvent`,
  and the associated OpenLineage option/result interfaces.
- Python binding functions:
  `openlineage_column_lineage`, `openlineage_job_event`, and
  `openlineage_run_event`.
- Documentation for OpenLineage output in the root README, TypeScript SDK
  README, and Python bindings README.
- Focused Rust, WASM, TypeScript SDK, and Python regression coverage for the
  new OpenLineage payload generation paths.

### Notes
- OpenLineage transport/client behavior remains intentionally out of scope.
  Polyglot generates JSON-compatible payloads for callers to inspect, persist,
  or emit through their own infrastructure.
- OpenLineage JSON Schema URLs are emitted as fixed `schemaURL` / `_schemaURL`
  references. Schemas are not downloaded or validated at runtime.

## [0.3.11] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Regression coverage for issue #201 across Rust, Python, C FFI, WASM, and the
  TypeScript SDK.
- TypeScript/WASM builder `toSql(dialect?)` support for `Expr` and
  `CaseBuilder`, allowing builder-generated SQL to use dialect-specific
  generation rules instead of always using the generic dialect.

### Fixed
- T-SQL `NCHAR`/`NVARCHAR` parsing and generation now preserves national
  character types for T-SQL identity transpilation, including `NVARCHAR(MAX)`.
- Fabric generation now maps unsupported `NCHAR`/`NVARCHAR` casts to
  `CHAR`/`VARCHAR` while preserving lengths, including `(MAX)`.
- Snowflake timestamp variant casts now parse and generate consistently for
  `TIMESTAMP_TZ`, `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`, and their no-underscore
  aliases with optional precision.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- Rust AST table transform options for table qualification and table renaming,
  including generated aliases for unaliased tables/subqueries, configurable
  alias prefixes, set-operation subquery normalization, and optional aliases for
  renamed tables.
- WASM AST transform exports for table qualification and table renaming with
  options: `ast_qualify_tables` and `ast_rename_tables_with_options`.
- TypeScript SDK visitor helpers for `qualifyTables` and enhanced
  `renameTables` options.
- Python binding functions `qualify_tables` and `rename_tables`, accepting both
  single expressions and expression lists.
- C FFI AST transform functions `polyglot_qualify_tables` and
  `polyglot_rename_tables_with_options`.
- Regression coverage for PostgreSQL-to-T-SQL/Fabric transpilation, AST table
  transforms, Python transform bindings, and FFI transform bindings.

### Fixed
- T-SQL and Fabric generation now emulate unsupported `NULLS FIRST` /
  `NULLS LAST` ordering with CASE sort keys when required, while avoiding that
  rewrite for random ordering expressions.
- Fabric `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` generation now uses T-SQL-style `OFFSET ... ROWS` /
  `FETCH NEXT ... ROWS ONLY` syntax where appropriate.
- Table qualification now handles set-operation operands and parser-produced
  passthrough `SELECT * FROM (<set op>)` wrappers more reliably.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Python binding regression coverage for structured T-SQL `BEGIN TRY` /
  `BEGIN CATCH` parsing, ensuring parsed nodes are exposed as the typed
  `polyglot_sql.TryCatch` subclass.

### Fixed
- Python release builds now include the `TryCatch` expression variant in the
  native subclass dispatcher, fixing the non-exhaustive Rust match introduced
  by structured TRY/CATCH AST support.
- Python package exports and type stubs now expose `TryCatch`, and the stubs
  avoid shadowing `typing.Any` with the SQL expression subclass named `Any`.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- T-SQL regression coverage for structured `BEGIN TRY` / `BEGIN CATCH`
  parsing, traversal, SQL generation, and table extraction from block bodies.
- PostgreSQL-to-Fabric TPC-H regression coverage for all 22 benchmark queries.
- T-SQL regression coverage for multi-statement `DECLARE` batches, including
  table variables followed by `INSERT` and scalar declarations followed by
  `SELECT`.
- AST transform regression coverage for DML statements, including
  `UPDATE ... FROM/JOIN`, PostgreSQL `DELETE ... USING`, and T-SQL
  `OUTPUT ... INTO` clauses.

### Fixed
- T-SQL `BEGIN TRY` / `BEGIN CATCH` blocks now parse into structured AST nodes
  instead of opaque command text, so traversal, lineage, scope analysis, and
  generation can inspect the inner statements.
- T-SQL `DECLARE` parsing now preserves top-level statement boundaries, so
  batches such as `DECLARE @tmp TABLE (...); INSERT INTO @tmp SELECT ...` parse
  as separate statements.
- `transform_recursive`, `rename_tables`, and `replace_by_type` now visit table
  references and expression fields inside `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements,
  including DML targets, `FROM`/`USING` sources, joins, `OUTPUT`, `RETURNING`,
  `WITH`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Full-corpus ClickHouse normalized round-trip verification for
  `make test-rust-clickhouse-coverage`, covering all 85,380 extracted fixture
  statements.

### Changed
- ClickHouse coverage now validates stable same-dialect normalization
  (`parse -> transform/generate -> parse -> transform/generate`) instead of
  exact source identity, while preserving the complete fixture corpus total and
  requiring `85,380/85,380` passing statements.

### Fixed
- ClickHouse parser/generator regressions for terminal backslash-escaped string
  quotes, native `COALESCE`/`IFNULL` spelling, prefix `NOT` precedence, nested
  lambda bodies, single-value `IN` lists, `sum(NULL)`, and same-dialect
  `EXCEPT ALL` identity output.
- ClickHouse normalization stability for malformed corpus probes and dialect
  syntax including partial `WITH` statements, incomplete extracted subqueries,
  `SAMPLE`, TTL `SET`, `Enum8`/`Enum16`, table-function CTAS, quoted dotted
  aliases, and `ALTER TABLE ... UPDATE` mutations.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- BigQuery parser support for alias-first `UNNEST ... WITH OFFSET` table
  expressions, including `UNNEST(arr) AS elem WITH OFFSET AS off` and
  normalization of `WITH OFFSET off` to `WITH OFFSET AS off`.
- Focused round-trip coverage for BigQuery `UNNEST` with offset aliases in
  both `FROM` and `CROSS JOIN` table expressions.

### Changed
- Updated SQLGlot and ClickHouse fixture pins to `v30.7.0` and
  `v26.2.17.31-stable`.
- Cleaned up Makefile target metadata, help output, and `.PHONY` coverage so
  advertised development commands resolve consistently.

### Fixed
- SQLGlot fixture compatibility for updated dialect identity and transpilation
  cases, including MySQL DDL/charset forms, DuckDB FROM-first joins, Redshift
  approximate percentile and interval output, Snowflake string/array/UUID
  rewrites, Oracle `JSON_TABLE ... FORMAT JSON`, Exasol `OPEN`, and BigQuery
  drop-primary-key forms.
- Fabric/T-SQL interval arithmetic rewrites for additional interval expression
  shapes, including cast interval values and colon parameters.
- Broken `make test-rust-functions` target, which now runs the existing
  function-focused library tests.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- PostgreSQL and SQLite transpilation regressions around TPCH-style stack-heavy
  queries and dialect-specific expression rewrites.
- Snowflake parser support for dollar-string literals in `PUT`/`FROM` command
  forms and UUID-like paths in stage references.
- Python compatibility tests for Snowflake connector command handling.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Databricks parser support for additional Delta Lake and Lakeflow command
  forms:
  - `CREATE TABLE ... DEEP CLONE ... VERSION/TIMESTAMP AS OF ...`
  - `REPAIR TABLE` / `MSCK REPAIR TABLE`
  - `APPLY CHANGES INTO`, `AUTO CDC INTO`, and `CREATE FLOW ... AS AUTO CDC`
  - `GENERATE symlink_format_manifest FOR TABLE ...`
  - `CONVERT TO DELTA ...`
- Snowflake scripting block support for `DECLARE ... BEGIN ... END` cursor
  blocks, including cursor `OPEN` and `RETURN TABLE(RESULTSET_FROM_CURSOR(...))`
  command bodies.
- PostgreSQL to T-SQL/Fabric rewrites for scalar array comparisons:
  `= ANY(ARRAY[...])` and `= ANY((...))` now emit `IN (...)`, with empty
  arrays rewritten to an always-false predicate.

### Changed
- Raw command parsing now preserves original source text when available, keeping
  dialect-specific quoted paths and procedural command bodies intact.

### Fixed
- Databricks parsing failures for Delta maintenance, clone, CDC, manifest, and
  conversion commands.
- Snowflake parsing failures for anonymous scripting blocks with cursor
  declarations.
- Regression coverage for MySQL stored procedures using `SIGNAL SQLSTATE` inside
  `BEGIN ... END` blocks.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- Native stack-growth support for deep parser/transform paths via the default
  `stacker` feature, while keeping WASM builds stacker-free.
- Stack-focused regression coverage for deeply nested transpilation and
  ClickHouse/Snowflake parser edge cases.

### Changed
- Refactored recursive parser/transform hot paths to reduce per-level stack
  usage and remove unnecessary manually enlarged test/runtime stacks.
- Updated ClickHouse and sqlglot verification fixtures for the current
  transpilation behavior.
- Documented stack-size behavior, default native safety settings, and WASM/FFI
  integration notes in the README.

### Fixed
- Snowflake Python connector query parsing failures involving empty argument
  lists, optional ODBC call wrappers, and connector-specific SQL forms.
- Deep transpilation/normalization stack handling for large generated queries
  without relying on oversized worker-thread stacks by default.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `Dialect::transpile` and `Dialect::transpile_with` — the new canonical method
  API for transpilation from a `Dialect` handle. Both accept either a
  `DialectType` enum or a `&Dialect` reference as the target via the new
  `TranspileTarget` trait (implemented for both).
- `TranspileOptions` struct (`#[non_exhaustive]`) carrying transpile
  configuration, with `TranspileOptions::pretty()` helper for pretty-printed
  output. Derives `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (camelCase) for JSON bridges.
- `TranspileTarget` trait — end users don't normally implement this themselves;
  the blanket impls for `DialectType` and `&Dialect` cover built-in and custom
  dialects uniformly.
- `polyglot_sql::transpile_with_by_name` free function — string-keyed variant
  of the new API, used by the C FFI and Python bindings.
- **C FFI**: new `polyglot_transpile_with_options(sql, from, to, options_json)`
  function. `options_json` is a JSON object compatible with `TranspileOptions`,
  e.g. `{"pretty": true}`.

### Changed
- **Breaking (Rust API)**: `polyglot_sql::transpile` and
  `polyglot_sql::transpile_by_name` now apply the full cross-dialect rewrite
  pipeline (`cross_dialect_normalize`) — matching the WASM / FFI / Python
  bindings and the playground. Previously these two entry points bypassed
  source+target-aware normalization, so Rust/Python/C FFI consumers silently
  received under-transformed SQL (including semantically wrong output for some
  DuckDB → Trino patterns such as `CAST(x AS JSON)` and `to_timestamp(x)`).
- `transform_recursive` now recurses into `Expression::CreateView.query`, so
  cross-dialect transforms apply inside view bodies (e.g.
  `CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT to_timestamp(x) FROM t`).

### Removed
- **Breaking (Rust API)**: removed `Dialect::transpile_to`,
  `Dialect::transpile_to_pretty`, `Dialect::transpile_to_dialect`, and
  `Dialect::transpile_to_dialect_pretty` — superseded by the unified
  `Dialect::transpile` / `Dialect::transpile_with` pair.
  - Migration: `dialect.transpile_to(sql, DialectType::X)` →
    `dialect.transpile(sql, DialectType::X)`
  - Migration: `dialect.transpile_to_pretty(sql, DialectType::X)` →
    `dialect.transpile_with(sql, DialectType::X, TranspileOptions::pretty())`
  - Migration: `dialect.transpile_to_dialect(sql, &target)` →
    `dialect.transpile(sql, &target)`

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Rust-side pre-parse formatting guard for deep set-operation chains (`UNION` / `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT`) with new error code `E_GUARD_SET_OP_CHAIN_EXCEEDED`.
- New FFI API: `polyglot_format_with_options(sql, dialect, options_json)` to override formatting guard limits per call.
- Python formatting per-call guard overrides via keyword-only arguments on `format_sql(...)` / `format(...)`:
  - `max_input_bytes`
  - `max_tokens`
  - `max_ast_nodes`
  - `max_set_op_chain`

### Changed
- Formatting guard defaults now include `maxSetOpChain = 256` to fail fast before deep set-op stack-overflow scenarios in large generated queries.
- ClickHouse `minus(...)` is treated as a function call in set-op guard detection (not as a set operation), avoiding false positives.

### Fixed
- Large/deep set-operation formatting now returns deterministic guard failures instead of process-level stack overflows in affected cases.
- FFI and Python interfaces are now aligned with Rust/WASM/SDK by supporting per-call formatting guard configuration.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- New `polyglot-sql-python` crate with first-party Python bindings (PyO3 + maturin) for parse, transpile, generate, format, validate, diff, lineage, and optimize flows.
- Release CI support for Python package publishing (multi-platform wheel builds + PyPI publish on `v*` tags).
- Dedicated benchmark project in `tools/bench-compare` with isolated `uv` environment management.

### Fixed
- Python local build/test artifacts are now ignored in git (`__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, coverage files, and related caches).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- New `polyglot-sql-ffi` crate with a C-compatible API surface for parse, transpile, generate, format, validate, diff, lineage, and optimize flows.
- Generated C header and end-to-end C example (`examples/c`) for native integration.
- Release CI now builds multi-platform FFI artifacts and publishes archives plus checksums to GitHub Releases for `v*` tags.
- Playground capabilities for lineage and schema-aware validation workflows.

### Changed
- SDK/WASM bridge now supports structured value APIs (`transpile_value`, `parse_value`, `generate_value`, `format_sql_value`, `get_dialects_value`) to reduce JSON serialization overhead.
- Parser now rebalances long `AND`/`OR` chains into bounded-depth trees to improve stack behavior on very large predicates.
- CI release pipeline hardening for SDK/WASM/docs/playground version consistency checks against the release tag.
- Build/test flow updates across Makefile and CI to keep Rust, WASM, SDK, docs, playground, and FFI outputs aligned.

### Fixed
- Large-SQL formatting robustness (issue #27 reproduction case) for high condition counts in WASM/SDK usage.
- WASM->TypeScript AST shape compatibility regressions by using JSON-compatible structured serialization.
- Additional parser, optimizer, and validation edge cases discovered during large-query and release-hardening work.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Schema-aware validation Phase 2 capabilities in `polyglot-sql`:
  - optional type checks (`check_types`)
  - optional reference/FK checks (`check_references`)
  - expanded schema model for keys and references
  - new diagnostics (`E210-E217`, `W210-W216`, `E220`, `E221`, `W220`, `W221`, `W222`)
- WASM and TypeScript SDK wiring for the new schema validation metadata and options.
- Additional validation coverage in Rust, WASM, and SDK tests for type/reference rules.

### Changed
- Canonical SQL generation for `NOT IN` in the WASM builder path to avoid non-canonical output.
- SDK build pipeline now performs WASM extraction/rewrite via a Vite plugin instead of a standalone post-build script.
- WASM release optimization profile no longer uses `--converge` to reduce build-time variance in `wasm-opt`.
- CI release hardening:
  - SDK typecheck in the `sdk-build` job
  - deploy-time docs version assertion against release tag
  - deploy-time playground SDK/WASM version assertion against release tag

### Fixed
- Multiple schema validation edge cases around comparison, arithmetic, assignment, set-ops, and join/reference quality diagnostics.
- Strict/non-strict severity behavior alignment for new validation rule families.
- Generated TypeScript binding diagnostics in the SDK:
  - removed problematic doc-comment patterns that broke generated JSDoc parsing
  - removed `Index.ts` renaming in binding copy flow to avoid case-sensitive import conflicts
